<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Kendra Patel! I am a first year software engineer at RIT. I graduated from Bishop Guertin High School in New Hampshire last summer. I am from Mass but I went to high school in NH. I love to watch and play sports. I mainly play basketball but I love watch soccer especially the premier league. I have a twin brother who is also attending RIT, but he is civil engineering. I am playing bass drum for the pep band and I am excited to watch some hockey this winter! </p>

<p>My favorite food is steak!</p>
